**NOTE**  
---  
To pair or re-pair this remote, hold the **Return** and **OK** buttons.  
  
OptiSigns Players also support the [**Mobile Admin App**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App) as a Remote Control. This is our _**top recommendation,**_ as not only does it function as a true remote control (allowing you to control your players from anywhere), but it has numerous other features as well.

If your remote control is having issues:

  * Ensure batteries have been installed inside your remote control, and that they are not dead
  * Re-pair your remote control with the player
  * Try a plug-in USB keyboard or mouse
  * Use the Mobile Admin app to set up Wi-Fi, or as a remote control itself



### Blank Screen Troubleshooting

If your device and screen are on, but only displays a black screen:

  * Network issues, **see above**.
  * Check to make sure there is a Playlist or Asset assigned to your screen.
  * Make sure your Timezones and Schedules match, including your Operational Schedule and normal schedule.
  * Check your firewall settings, and ensure you’ve [**Whitelisted OptiSigns IP addresses and ports**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934-Whitelist-OptiSigns-IP-addresses-ports).
  * Check your Operational Schedule, and verify its power settings are not set to Off. If an Operation Schedule’s power settings are set to Off, it will remain off during the designed time.



If the device is still not displaying content after you’ve checked these, check our **Content Playback Troubleshooting**section, then try a **Factory Reset**.

### Changing Device Time Zone

When [**setting a schedule**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853-Create-and-Using-Schedules-with-OptiSigns), it's critical that the portal and device share the same time zone. If the time zones are not identical, it can cause your schedule to start at a different time than you'd like. The issue is usually the device's time zone.

To do this, you'll need to change it. Start by pressing the **Home button** on your remote (or hit **Exit App** from the Side Menu), and navigate to the **Settings** menu.
