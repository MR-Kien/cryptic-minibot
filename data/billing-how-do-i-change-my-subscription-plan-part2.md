Currently (as of late 2024), we offer two terms:

  * **Monthly:** A straight fee, paid each month. The most basic subscription type.
  * **Yearly:** A commitment to pay for a single screen for a year, but with a 10% discount.



Choose whichever you prefer, then hit **Next**.

You'll be asked to put in your payment information:

Once the relevant information has been input, hit **Update subscription**.

Once that's done, you'll see an itemized breakdown, showing your plan, the number of screens, the Subtotal, the amount paid in Sales Tax (varies by location), and an estimate for your next bill.

Finally, hit **Continue**.

Congratulations! You've changed the terms of your OptiSigns subscription.
