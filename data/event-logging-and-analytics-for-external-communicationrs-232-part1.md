With OptiSigns you can enable track of the data communication between the digital signage player and external devices through external communication (RS232). The feature is available for customers on Enterprise plan. 

Once it is enabled, it will keep tracking of the inbound/outbound event data that was sent between the digital signage player and external devices. For example, if you are using IoT sensors, the feature can track the serial command that was sent from your sensors, and you can analyze the data to monitor and further optimize your IoT sensors usage. Or you can track the RS232 commands(power on/off, mute/unmute etc) that was sent to your TVs and use it as a proof of your compliance. 

### **Prerequisite:**

To use this feature, you will need to confirm in advance that the connection between your digital signage player and external devices are working properly. 

The external communication(RS-232) should be configured and tested. Depending on your use case, you can follow below listed documents.

  * If you are using RS-232 commands to communicate with your TV, please check the[ advanced scheduling feature](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/9061950942995-Using-RS-232-to-Schedule-TV-Power-On-Off-or-other-commands).

Note: To test and confirm your external communication(RS-232) connection and configuraiton are set up properly, you can use the "Trigger Event Viewer" from the side menu of OptiSigns player. It can show the events received from external devices/sensors, and also you can use it to test send commands out to external devices.
