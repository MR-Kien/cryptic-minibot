### Via Mobile Admin App

The OptiSigns [Mobile Admin App](https://www.optisigns.com/mobile-app) lets you remotely control your devices in the same way as above. Simply download the app, and access your digital signage hardware through your mobile device.

See our [Mobile Admin App article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App) for more information.

## For Multiple OptiSigns Players

It’s possible to send basic remote commands to individual players, segments of OptiSigns players (defined via [tagging](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/38062664690195-Tagging-in-OptiSigns)), or all your OptiSigns players simultaneously. These commands allow for mass provisioning, updating, and troubleshooting. This section applies to Pro and ProMax players only, not the OptiStick.

The ability to do this needs to be activated. Simply contact us at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) to be given the ability to send remote commands.

### Enabling Remote Commands Feature on Account

Remote Command Execution is disabled by default. To use it, it will need to be turned on. To do this, navigate to[ the Preferences section](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/preference-settings) in the OptiSigns portal.

For security reasons, **only the account owner** can enable or disable Remote Command Execution.
