You can edit both the template and the Repeater in Designer!

**The Repeater can be found on the side menu of the Designer application.**

Within the Repeaters section, it will contain several ready to use "**Repeater components** " and "**Repeater Templates.** "

What is the Difference Between the two?  
---  
**Repeater Component:** designed to manage and display repeating elements along with some design elements. You can incorporate this Repeater component into any template design of your choice—it doesn't need to be a Repeater template. Once added, you simply connect it to your data source. Think of it as a widget that can be easily implemented and customized across different designs to dynamically display data.  
**Repeater Template:** specifically designed to display repeating elements within a predefined template or design layout. Like other templates, it will replace any existed design when applied. You can still make edits and changes as desired. Again, users will only need to download it and connect to your desired data source.   
  
Any of these elements can have a DataSource mapped to them, then be edited in the same manner as any other Designer component.
