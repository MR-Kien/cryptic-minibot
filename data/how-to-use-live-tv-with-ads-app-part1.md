  * Make the ads jiggle, this will capture much more attention (see how below).
  * Make time based, localize ads (i.e. $2 off beers in next 30min) which will create a sense of urgency and proven to have better conversion.
  * Place it on TV program that people actively watching (Sport is great example).
