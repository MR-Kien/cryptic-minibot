Similarly, Objects has been renamed to Layers and moved to the left-hand side menu. This allows you to edit the positioning or layering of any of the elements of your design.

To access Layers:

  * Select the **layered icon** on the right side
  * OR select **Position**
  * Select **Layers**



Then you can select any of the elements and move them around to change their position or "layering."

### History

This new feature allows you to track all your most recent changes to your design. 

Careful! Clicking on a previous “event” and starting to make changes to your design will erase any events created after that specific event. 

To access History: 

  * Select the **layered icon** on the right side 
  * OR select **Position** button from the t0ol bar
  * **History** is the right option that will pop up in the side menu
  * **Click** any event to move to that point in your editing

### Canvas Resize Options

We have added Landscape and Portrait options to the Resizing option for greater ease of use. This allows you to reshape your canvas and design with a click of a button. Made the design in landscape but you need it for a screen in portrait mode? No worries!

  * Select **Resize** from the tool bar
  * Deselect **Maintain Aspect Ratio**
  * Select **Portrait** or **Landscape**

## New Exciting Features in Designer 2.0

### Reusable Component Library

This feature allows you to save any design element or grouped elements to a component library. Save any element you like and create a library of branded or themed elements, or simply one that you wanted to save for later!

To add the component: 

  * Click on **the element** you would like to save
  * Select **More**
  * Select **Add Component**



To access the components: 

  * Click on **Your Temp** from the left side bar
  * Click on **Components**



You will now be able to add to any design!

This works with elements or designs you create, whole templates from our library, or single elements from a template.
