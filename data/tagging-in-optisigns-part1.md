Tagging is an essential tool for keeping your content and screens organized. They can be applied to any asset to allow for seamless sorting, and applied to screens to help identify screen location, screen type, hardware, and far more.

**NOTE**

Asset and screen tagging are distinct from [**content tags in playlists**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist).

## Screen Tagging

Your screens can be tagged in much the same way as an asset. This has a number of different uses:

  * Organizing numerous screens, by location, type of screen, etc.
  * Grouping sets of screens together for quick pushes of assets or playlists
  * Allowing Emergency Messages/CAP Alerts to appear on certain screens with specific tags
  * Enabling Remote Commands to be able to alter the content displayed on multiple screens at once



You can add as many different tags as you want to a screen. Please note that these screen tags are separate from those tags you may have applied to your assets. For more information on tagging assets, see the **Asset Tagging**section later in this article.

To tag your screens, select the screens, then hit **Edit**.

### Pushing to Multiple Screens

The most commonly used feature of screen tagging is the ability to push content - be that an asset, playlist, or schedule - to multiple screens at once.

To do this, find the piece of content you wish to push, then click the **Three Dots** :
