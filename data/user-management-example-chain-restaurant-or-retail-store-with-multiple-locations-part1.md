## Identifying the Need

The first step to organizing your portal is knowing what kind of management structure you want in place for your digital signage.

Do you want a centrally managed solution, where the end users have no or limited control over the content for their signs? Do you want a large number of independently functioning end users, with total control over their content? Do you want something in between? Identifying how you want your account users to interact with the platform is the first step in this process, and will be critical for the setup.
