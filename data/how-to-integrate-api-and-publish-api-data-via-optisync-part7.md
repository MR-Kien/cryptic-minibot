Once the API DataSource has been created, you're ready to map the data.

In Designer, open your DataSource.

Click on it and a screen similar to this will pop up:

Opening up any of these will display the data pulled from your API:

By clicking on any piece of this data and dragging it onto the screen, the data will appear. You'll have the option to use the data as a Repeater or on its own.

In this case, we want to use it on its own. For menus, a Repeater makes the most sense.

In order to check the data binding, you can click on any mapped element, then click **Settings**. You will see the **Asset Element Name** there.

We have the item name and price from the API mapped to the design. When published on the screen, the value will be automatically replaced with the value from the API. If updates are made in the Clover POS system, the change will be reflected on the screen automatically.

Repeat this step for all the elements that you want to map to the API data source, and save the design. Your design is ready to go.
