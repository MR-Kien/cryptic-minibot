Hit **Save**. Now we need to make sure the Resource calendar is set up in Outlook.

## Step 2: Displaying the Resource in the User's Outlook Calendar

Log in to Outlook with the user you wish to display OptiSigns on. Hit **Add Calendar** :

![microsoft outlook add calendar](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619197986323)

Next, click **Add from Directory** , then **Select an Account**. 

![microsoft outlook add calendar directory](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619197986963)

You'll choose your User account here:

![add from directory choose email](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619214166163)

You'll be asked to Select a person, group, or resource from your organization's directory. Find the desired Resource's **email address**. This can be found on your Resources page in your Exchange Admin portal:

![use room email](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619197987987)![select room from email](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619197989011)

Once it has been found and entered, it will appear on the list:

![room resource on list](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619214169875)

When you try and exit, you'll be asked to Save changes. Do so.

![save changes to outlook calendar](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45619214170515)

Now the Resource's calendar will populate on this User's calendar display.
