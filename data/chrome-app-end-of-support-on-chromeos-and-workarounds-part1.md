Google is phasing out **Chrome Apps** on Chrome OS. The OptiSigns Chrome App (available in the[ Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/optisigns-digital-signage/ankpffnbahhgegojammhgdnbmdbfnnfe)) is affected by this change and may no longer run on certain Chrome OS versions.

If your Chrome OS device can no longer run the OptiSigns Chrome App, you can still use OptiSigns by downloading our app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.optisigns.playe1&hl=en-US), or our **Android APK** version directly from our [website](https://download.optisignsapp.com/Android/optisigns_googleVersion_release_latest_stable.apk). The latter option requires access to Developer Mode.
