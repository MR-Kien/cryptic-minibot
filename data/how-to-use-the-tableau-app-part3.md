Now go back to the OptiSigns portal and hit **Files/Assets** → **Apps:**

![optisigns files/assets tab app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613937555)

Now find the **Tableau** app.

![tableau app optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250660711955)

Clicking the app will open this window:

  * **Name -** The name of your Asset. This is used entirely in OptiSigns and can be anything you like.
  * **Tableau Shared Report URL -** This is where you’ll input the Share URL you copied earlier.
  * **Update Interval -** Denotes how often the app will sync, measured in seconds.
  * **Authenticate with Connected App Integration -** Tick this box if you want to use Private reports. Since we set this up in Steps 1 and 2, we recommend ticking this box. If you skipped those steps and only want to use Public reports, no need to check the box.

**NOTE**  
---  
Tableau Cloud only allows 600 Update Interval requests per user/hour. See **Note 3** for more information and solutions on how to handle this.  
  
Now it's time to authenticate your Shared Report URL with an appropriate Connected App Integration you set up earlier:

  * **Connected App Integration -** Select the integration you set up in Step 2 in this box.



Once you input the **Tableau Shared Report URL** and have selected your Integration, hit **Save** and your report should appear as a Preview:

Once you have tailored it to your liking, you can **Close** it. This will create a Tableau asset that can be added to a Playlist or directly assigned to a screen:

In order to display different tabs of a report, select the tab you'd like to view on Tableau site, then hit **Share** , same way as before:

![tableau report share](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250660703635)

You'll then create a new Asset with that Share link as the **Site URL** :
