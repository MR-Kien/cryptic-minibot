**TIP**  
---  
The ethernet cable must be able to reach and connect to the port inside the leg. Ensure the correct leg goes into the correct base slot.  
  
#### **3\. Secure the Legs to the Base**

  * Reinsert and tighten the screws to firmly attach the legs to the base.



We recommend doing this step while the kiosk is still lying flat.

#### **4\. Connect Internal Cables**

**Ethernet Connection (Leg 1)**

  * Inside the leg aligned with the ethernet cable, plug the cable (coming from the base) into the ethernet port inside the leg.

**Power Connections (Leg 2)**

  * Two power cables are tucked inside the base and lead into the second leg.
  * If the cables are difficult to access, you can:
    * Unscrew the small back panel on the base
    * Pull out the cables
    * Screw the panel back on after connection



**Which Cable Goes Where?**

Inside the leg, there are two power ports side-by-side:

  * Top port (closer to the top of the kiosk when upright):  
Connect the power cable that has a yellow wire.
  * Bottom port (closer to the base):  
Connect the power cable without the yellow wire.



The photo below will help you identify these parts.

**5\. Attach the Wheels**

  * Flip the base slightly to access the bottom.
  * Screw in the 4 caster wheels into the pre-threaded holes.



**6\. Power Up the Kiosk**

  * Carefully raise the kiosk to a standing position.
  * Plug the provided power cord into a wall outlet.
  * Locate the power switch on the kiosk and turn it on.



The kiosk will boot up and be ready for use.

### Step 2: Connect to the Internet

Your kiosk must be connected to the internet to display content. You can connect using either of the following methods:

**Method 1: Connect via WiFi Settings**

  1. On the Welcome Screen, tap anywhere to open the WiFi setup. Or, open the Settings app → Network & Internet → Internet.
  2. Select your WiFi network and enter your password.



**Method 2: Connect using the OptiSigns Admin App**

  1. On the Welcome Screen, follow the instructions to download the OptiSigns Admin App.
  2. Use the app to configure WiFi on the kiosk.



**Optional: Confirm Your Connection**
