### Scale Repeater Images

New scaling options are available for images in Repeaters. You are now able to select Fit, Zoom, or Stretch to have it better fit your design. 

To customize the image size in a Repeater to your preference:

  * Select the **repeater image**
  * Select **Settings**
  * Select **Scale**

### Background Remover

Automatically detects and removes backgrounds from images. It currently only supports auto-removal and at present it is not possible to custom erase or restore the background. 

To remove the background:

  * Select **Background Remover** from the tool bar
  * Wait for the **loading icon** to finish
  * Click **Save**



Afterwards, it will simply disappear!

### Image Masking

Our new tool allows you to apply shapes or elements as masks to images. 

  * Click on the **Mask** icon from the tool bar
  * Select any **shape** or search for more shapes on the left side menu

The mask and the image attach automatically when you select it. 

To edit the placement on the picture, **Edit Mask** detaches the overlaid shape. 

**Apply Mask** reapplies it and groups it back together. 

To delete the shape altogether, select **Remove Mask**. 

### Google Font Weights Support

We now have full font weight options for our Google Fonts (for example, Thin, Light, Regular, Bold). 

Note: This is only available for Google Fonts.

To change the font weight: 

  * **Select** the text you would like to change or add a text box 
  * **Click** the font name on the tool bar
  * **Choose** a font from the left side menu



If the font you choose is a Google font, the options will drop down underneath the font name.
