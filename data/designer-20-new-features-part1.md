## Design Differences in Designer 2.0

### Left-Aligned Side Menu

The biggest change for users will be the look and placement of functions in Designer 2.0. The new version streamlines the design, left-aligning a lot of the previous buttons and functions. 

Most functions are now relocated to the left-hand side.

The left side menu will also replace the pop-up window that was utilized for certain functions.

The functions now in the left side menu include: 

  * Position
  * Layers, formerly called “Objects” 
  * Data Sources
  * Animation
  * Widget format options
  * Settings
  * Text
  * And more



For example, Animations controls will now appear in the left side menu.

### Effects

Effects is the new category for accessing visual effects. This includes some of our previous functions, such as Shadow, Outline, Texture, Gradient, and Opacity.

To access these functions: 

  * **Select** Effects
  * **Choose** any of the functions from the side menu
