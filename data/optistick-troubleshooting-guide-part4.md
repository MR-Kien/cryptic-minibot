  * Create a mobile hotspot, then have your OptiStick connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.



To see what network you’re connected to, go to the Side Menu and hit **Exit**. This will close the OptiSigns app.

Next, open the menu on the side using the remote. If connected to a network, it should appear here. If not, you'll need to set that back up.

### Power Troubleshooting

One of the most common causes of device instability is not using the provided power adapters and cables.

If your device has any sort of intermittent power issues, _**please ensure it is not being powered by the USB port on your screen**_. The USB port does not provide enough power to the device to keep it running under all conditions.

In the event there is no available power outlet nearby and the USB port is your only option, keep your content load light - meaning, no videos, no large files, etc.

### HDMI & TV Connection Troubleshooting

If you’re having problems connecting your OptiStick to your HDMI port or TV, here are some steps to try:

  * Try a different HDMI port on your screen
  * Try to connect the OptiStick directly to your TV without the HDMI extended
  * Try a different TV or monitor to see if it will work at all



If none of these work, contact our support team at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com).
