The **Text** option allows you to insert text into the design.

Text can be chosen from either the Top Menu or the Side Menu. Either will open the Side Menu for more options:

Clicking **Add a text box** or one of the Predefined text options will add a text box to the Designer View:

Do as the prompt says, and numerous options open up to you. First, the Text itself has a full set of options:

Clicking the text also alters the Top Menu:

Double-clicking or selecting the text allows you to enter text directly.

Text can be resized at will.

---  
How your text is resized is determined by which part of the text you drag from. If you drag **from the sides** , this will **Crop** your text and force it to fit into a smaller range. Dragging **from the corners** will maintain the aspect ratio of the selection and change the size of the font automatically.  
  
Lastly, single clicking the text, then holding down the mouse button and dragging allows you to reposition the text.

### Shapes

The **Shapes** option allows you to add premade shapes or elements to the design.

Here, you can choose between **Shapes** and **Elements** to add to the design. There are a vast number of these, so pick ones which suit your needs.

Clicking a Shape or Element will add it to the design:
