### Creating a Basic Video Wall

To create a basic video wall, select the number of screens and their orientation. Once you’ve done so, you’ll see the following:

Notice that each screen is known as a **Zone** , mapped to the HDMI ports on your OptiSigns Pro Player. Make sure your screens are arranged in the order displayed here, as it cannot be changed.

There are a few options to note:

**Name** \- The name of your Video Wall App.

**Zone Name** \- The name of the designated zone. Depending on which option you picked, there will be two or three zones. These default to the name of the HDMI port on the OptiSigns Pro Player.
