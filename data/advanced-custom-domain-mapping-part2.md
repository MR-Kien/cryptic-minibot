**3) Activate SSL for your sub-domain**

Once you have done step 2, return to the Branding page:

<https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/branding-settings>

Enter the domain/sub-domain you have configured in Step 2 in Your domain section.

In this example, we use: login.abcmedia.com

Then click Activate.

This will trigger the process on OptiSigns side to activate SSL for your sub-domain. This will ensure that your user can use HTTPS: i.e. <https://login.abcmedia.com> to use the app.

This process can take up to 24-48 hours to complete. You will be notified via email once it's done.

#### **That's all!**

Once you get the notification that your SSL is activated, you can start using your own domain/sub-domain (i.e. <https://login.abcmedia.com>).
