### Kiosk Lite

Kiosk Lite is a quick and easy interactive solution for your kiosk. You can showcase an asset or playlist as ads. Then, when the kiosk encounters a simple interaction, it smoothly transitions to display your website URL.

**Use Case**

If you have a pre-built asset, such as a playlist, image, or video, that you want to use as an attract screen and then direct users to your website upon interaction, Kiosk Lite is the easiest method to get your kiosk up and running quickly. It's designed for easy use and quick setup, allowing you to get your kiosk running in minutes with engaging content that captures attention and drives user interaction.
