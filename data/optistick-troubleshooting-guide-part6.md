For some reason, Android devices lead with Midway Island, in the middle of the Pacific (some things in life are best left a mystery). Navigate to your preferred time zone and select it.

Now your device and schedule should sync properly.

**NOTE**  
---  
These steps can be performed remotely using the **Mobile Admin App** or through **MDM Commands**. The OptiStick needs to be connected and online for these commands to go through.  
  
### How to Factory Reset the OptiStick

You can factory reset your OptiStick Player if the system is not functioning properly or the OptiStick system will not load.

There are two ways to do a factory reset.

#### Soft Reset

A soft reset can be performed if the system is still accessible and operational. This will erase all the data on the device, and may help improve performance and fix some issues.

On the Home screen, go to **Settings**. Hit **Device Preferences,** then choose **About**. Finally, choose **Factory Reset.**

It will ask if you’re sure you’d like to perform this function. If you are, hit **OK**. The soft factory reset will take place.

#### Hard Reset

When certain Android system files are corrupted, the device will not be able to boot into the Android system. In this case, you will need to perform a hard reset.

To perform one, you’ll need a small tool. Think paperclip, needle, or SIM card pin. Then, ensure the device is completely powered off and the USB power cable is unplugged from the device.

Next, use your small tool to press into the small hole on the side of the device. Hold it, then plug in the power cable while the tool is still pressing the button in the small hole.

The system will then boot into recovery mode. You can use the button to navigate between selections and will need to press and hold for 1-2 secs to confirm selection. Choose **wipe data/factory reset** , and the factory reset will start.
