**2\. Record your Script**

From the Navigation Recorder extension pop out like in above screenshot, click **Start Recording.**

It will open an **Chrome Incognito window**.  
You can put in the URL of the website or page you want to start with.  
Then fill out the forms. (such as, entering your username, password and click Login)

### **Important Notes to Follow to Reduce Issues Later!**  
  
---  
**Always start with the destination URL** (The URL of the page you want to display). Let the website handle the redirection once you fill out the login information.  
**Always click the Login button,** instead of Enter.  
**Correctly enter your fields in 1 attempt!** Type slow and carefully. Don't use backspaces or arrows keys to modify. If you mess up, please restart this step from the beginning.
