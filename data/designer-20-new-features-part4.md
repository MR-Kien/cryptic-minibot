### Copy and Apply Style

This function allows you to easily copy and paste style settings, such as font, size, color, and effects, between elements.

This works for both text and shape elements. 

To change the style: 

  * **Select** the text or shape you would like to copy 
  * **Click** the Copy Style icon from the tool bar
  * **Drag** the icon to the text you would like to change

### Pan Tool

This allows you to pan around the canvas without moving design elements. This is useful if you are zoomed in on your design and would like to move to another part of the canvas without disturbing any of your elements. 

  * **Select** the hand icon on your right side menu 
  * **Use** the hand to move the design
  * **Unclick** the hand when you are finished

### Excel Date Format

We have corrected the issue where dates appear as serial numbers in DataSources. However, you must recreate the Excel file as a new DataSource for the fix to take effect. 

To learn more about adding Excel spreadsheets as DataSources, please reference [How to Set Up Dynamic Data Mapping](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync) and [Add an Excel Spreadsheet as a DataSource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29863080711059-How-to-add-a-Microsoft-365-Excel-Spreadsheet-as-a-DataSource-for-OptiSync).
