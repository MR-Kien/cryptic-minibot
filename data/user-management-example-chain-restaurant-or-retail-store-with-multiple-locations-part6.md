**NOTE**  
---  
Another option: it is possible to restrict folder access to users within the Default Team. This is a good option if you want your regional managers to have more access.  
  
This can be applied across OptiSigns, and it is possible to create similar nesting within the **Files/Assets** , **Playlists** , and **Schedules** area of the Portal:

![add folder in files/assets area](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657735771923)

  


![add folders in playlist and schedule area](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657783499411)

For simplicity, we recommend mirroring the same setup in each of these areas. This way, higher-level teams can share content, playlists, or schedules with many lower-level teams, but lower-level teams cannot share with each other.

Lastly, when creating a New Folder, these permissions can be set by clicking the **Advanced** button:

## Branding and Enforcing Brand Guidelines (Optional)

There are two parts to enforcing brand guidelines in OptiSigns: creating a branded portal, and enforcing brand guidelines on created content.

We have articles on each of these topics that explore them in more detail:

  * [**Custom Branding Settings**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000485202-Custom-Branding-Settings)
  * [**Brand Kit and Enforcing Brand Guidelines**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42313875427859-Brand-Kit-and-Enforcing-Brand-Guidelines)



Once configured, you’re ready to invite users.

## Adding Users: Via SSO, or Directly Via OptiSigns

To add users via OptiSigns, go back to where you created the Teams. You can **Add** or **Invite** users from here. See [**Managing User Roles**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046356113-Advanced-Security-Managing-User-Roles)**** for more information.

However, for our example, our hypothetical restaurant chain wants to enforce SSO via SAML.

To do this, go to our [**SSO & SAML**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/sections/26319189062803-SSO-SAML)**** section and follow the appropriate article. We highly recommend reading our [**SAML best practices**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407128433299-SAML-integration-strategy-best-practice)**** article, as well.

### That’s all!
