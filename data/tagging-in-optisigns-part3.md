## Asset Tagging

Tagging assets can be extremely helpful when you have many screens across many locations and when certain content does not apply to all screens.

For example, let’s say you want to advertise certain special deals in one location, but not another. This asset can be tagged with a simple “location” marker, which will signal where it should be displayed. You can apply as many tags as you like to a single asset.

Tags may only be applied to existing assets in OptiSigns. To learn how to create an asset, see our article on [**How to Upload and Manage Files and Assets**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016247974-How-to-Upload-Manage-Your-Files-Assets)**.**

Once there is an asset to tag, from within the **Files/Assets** tab on the OptiSigns portal, there are two methods to add/edit tags:

  1. Single asset
  2. Multiple (bulk) assets



### Single Asset Tagging

Single asset tagging is quite simple: just click the **Three Dots** on the asset you wish to tag, then choose **Edit Tags** from the drop down menu:

This will open up the Edit Tags menu for this single asset:

Clicking within the Tags field will bring up a list of existing tags that you can select from. You can also input a new tag here to create it.

This feature is most useful for adding individual tags to specific assets that may be different from those around it.

### Multi Asset Tagging

The most useful way to apply tags to large numbers of assets at once is by multi tagging. This is similar to applying tags to a single asset, except it can be used to apply the tag(s) to numerous assets at once.

In order to do this, you’ll need to click the Circle icon in the upper left corner of the assets you want to tag.

Once you’ve selected the assets you wish to apply the tag(s) to, click the “Edit Tags” button:
