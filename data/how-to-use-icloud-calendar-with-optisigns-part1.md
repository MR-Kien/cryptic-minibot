**Let's jump in and get started:**

#### **1\. Get Your App-Specific Password from Apple**

Before linking your iCloud calendar in Calendly, ensure you have your app-specific password from Apple. This unique password is distinct from your regular Apple login credentials.

Apple mandates the use of an app-specific password, in addition to two-factor authentication, for connecting with third-party apps like Calendly.

To obtain your app-specific password:

  1. Sign in to [https://appleid.apple.com/](https://appleid.apple.com/).
  2. Navigate to Security and activate [Two-factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102660) if you haven't already.
  3. Under App-Specific Passwords, click**Generate Password**.
