## Best Practices

  * Set up the [**Mobile Admin App**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App). This will allow you to use numerous features remotely, including the Remote Keyboard app and remote monitoring.
  * Keep the player in an indoor, air conditioned environment
  * Ensure your player is up-to-date. We release frequent OTA updates - see more below.



By default, our Pro Players are set to receive a weekly automatic OTA update at **Sunday 00:00** (also known as Saturday night). If the players are offline at that time, it’s possible to miss the OTA update. We recommend changing the OTA update to a time when the players are online, but not being used for anything mission critical.

These OTA updates often bring with them new and advanced features, stability updates, security updates, patches, and more, so we **_highly recommend_** scheduling an update time that works for you. If none do, be sure to occasionally **Check for Updates**.
