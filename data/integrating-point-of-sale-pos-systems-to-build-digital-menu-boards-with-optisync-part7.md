## Pushing Digital Menu Boards to Screens

Getting your new DMB onto a screen is relatively simple. Go back to the screens you set up with substitution parameters earlier. Then, hit **Edit Screen.**

Under **Type** , choose asset, then select your DMB asset to play.

## That's all!

You should be able to create an Digital Menu Board with dynamic data features.
