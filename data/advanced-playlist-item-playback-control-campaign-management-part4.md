By using the inclusion and exclusion boxes, you can choose which tagged assets appear or don't appear when content is pushed to your screen. For example below, by using "Inclusion > And > Front-Lobby", when that specific playlist is pushed to the screen, it will only show content tagged as Front-Lobby, it will exclude or skip over anything tagged something else.
