## What is an Attract Screen?

An **Attract Screen** is what your interactive kiosk will display until someone engages with the screen. Once the screen is interacted with, it will take the viewer to your kiosk. An attract screen could be anything you may want to display to attract passerby's to interact with your kiosk: a visual welcome screen, a rotating playlist of ads, a video of your product or brand, and more!

Here's a simple example we've created, showing you both the attract screen and interactive kiosk!

#### Now, let's get started!

## Creating an Attract Screen

First, you'll want to navigate to the [**Engage Management**](https://app.optisigns.com/app/engageManagement) page.

Select either **New App** or **Touch Screen** Kiosks → **Touch Screen Kiosks** → Click **Select App**

Select **Kiosk Designer** **Pro** → Click **Build**

You'll then be taken to our Designer Pro!

In Designer Pro, select **Widgets** → **Video** → **Select your video** from your asset library

Click on your video element → Click **Format Options** from the top menu bar

A **Format Options menu** will appear on the right side of the screen → Open **Position** → Click**"Use as Background"**

Your video will now become the background on Canvas and you can layer interactive elements over it!

### Linking An Element

For this example, we created a "Tap Here to Begin" button using shapes and texts available in Designer.

Once the element is created, select the element you'd like to be interactive→ Click **Link** → Click "**Add Link"** from the menu on the right.

You can link this element to a **Website URL** or to **an asset** within your asset library.

If you have more than 4 interactive/linked elements on a single page, you may run into performance issues.
