You’ll see a screen similar to this:

![virtual screen app config optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/36911639366931)

You’ll need to fill in the information on the side.

For this, there are a couple things to note.

First, the **Screen** you select will be what displays on your Microsoft Teams Rooms display. This screen should be configured with the digital signage you want to display there.

Second, the **Share Type** should be set to **URL Link**. It is this URL you will input into the Teams Rooms Professional Portal in the next step.

Now, hit **Save**. Your asset/playlist will show on the right side of the screen, and you’ll receive the URL you need.

This Virtual Room app will now be saved as an Asset on OptiSigns. By clicking on it, you will be able to access the URL anytime. You'll want to enter this into your Custom source within the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal.
