## What is Web Scripting

Web Scripting is a feature that allows users to automate navigation and form entry on websites without any coding. This tool records user actions, such as entering usernames and passwords, navigating to specific pages, handling pop-ups, running your own JavaScript and more on a website, and then encrypts the recorded script for secure execution on designated devices.

OptiSigns encrypt all the scripts and your password entered with our own private keys.

  * This will ensure your data/password is safe as soon as it left your browsers and only get decrypted at device level before the fields are entered.



We also provide Zero Knowledge encryption method so that you can protect your script with your own Master Password. _You can read more at the end of this article._

If your dashboard requires login with the 2FA, OptiSigns supports the 2FA in the Web Scripting app. You can read more [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/19145077187859).
