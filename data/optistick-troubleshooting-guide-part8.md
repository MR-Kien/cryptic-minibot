## OptiStick Player RMA Process

If none of the solutions here work, feel free to submit an RMA request. Devices will be tested as part of the RMA process, and if they are working correctly, you (the customer) will be charged a restocking fee.

Here are the steps for an RMA:

  1. Obtain a proof of purchase stating that your device was purchased within the last 12 months, complying with our 12-month warranty policy.
  2. Fill out [**this RMA request form**](https://share.hsforms.com/14BvoeL1JRlGgxr3ec_kdJgca5m5).
  3. RMA requests are reviewed within 3 business days.
  4. New devices arrive within 3-5 business days to most places in the United States.
  5. Return the old device within 30 days.
