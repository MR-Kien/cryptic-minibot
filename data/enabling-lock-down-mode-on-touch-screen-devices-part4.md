  * Unable to exit the app or access the control center to make changes to the device itself
  * If you press "Exit App" in guided access and lock down, it will close then reopen.



If you have many devices and would like to easier manage them, you can use the Apple Configurator. To learn more about this [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/start-single-app-mode-cadbf9c172/mac).

#### **Limitations**

  * **Lock Down Mode Unavailable on iOS:** The lockdown feature is not currently available for iOS devices. Guided Access is recommended to prevent users from controlling your device. However, users can still unpair, refresh the content, and change the orientation of your screen.
