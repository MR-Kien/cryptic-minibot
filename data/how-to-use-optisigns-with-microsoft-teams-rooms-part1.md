### In this article, we will explain how to set up OptiSigns for use with Microsoft Teams Rooms’ new Digital Signage option.

  * Prerequisites
  * Configure the Source within Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal and OptiSigns Web Player
  * Send to a Teams Rooms Device
  * Set Up the Virtual Screen App (ALTERNATE METHOD)



Microsoft has released a new Digital Signage option for their [Microsoft Teams Rooms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-rooms) application, which allows digital signage to be displayed on a Microsoft Teams Rooms device. This will cause Teams Rooms screens and devices to display digital signage content when idle.

The **Name and Description** sections are purely for MS Teams Rooms - provide a name and description which will help you identify your signs in case you want to make several. Once inputted, hit **Next**.

Now you’ll need to Select source. We recommend using the OptiSigns Web Player for this. It allows frequent updates and is extremely easy to set up. Simply input the following URL as your Custom Source:
