Content tagging in a playlist allows you to better control and customize the playback of your playlist items, enabling you to mix and match content for different screens within the same playlist and greatly simplifying screen management. By using content tags, you can set rules for your screens that determine which tagged assets or sub-playlists are displayed when your selected playlist is playing. This ensures precise and efficient control over the content displayed on each screen, eliminating the need to create separate playlists for different locations or scenarios.

**Let's jump in and get started:**

In your Playlist settings by clicking on the **Cog** icon > Selecting **Advanced** > Click on **Target tags** dropdown menu.

  * **Use Playlist Default:** You can create a tag(s) for the entire playlist. 
    * _For example, this is useful if you use nested playlists. When setting up rules in the next steps, you can either include or exclude entire playlists based on their tags._


  * **Use Asset Default:** The playlist will follow each individual assets' tags.



## **How to Set Up 'Use Asset Default'**
