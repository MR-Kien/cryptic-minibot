## Content Playback Troubleshooting

This section deals with common issues we see when trying to display content using an OptiStick Player.

### Website Display or Sizing Issues

To display a website as you would see it on a Desktop or PC, change Device Scaling to smallest.

For more information, see the relevant article on Device Scaling:

### Designer or Template Sizing Issues

If using the [**Designer app**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404151402899-How-to-use-OptiSigns-Template-Designer-app-to-make-your-Digital-Signs-in-minutes)**,** try setting the canvas size to 960x540, or change the display size on Android.

### Screen Color Distortion

If your screen is showing distorted colors or displays, try:

  * A different HDMI cable, port, or screen
  * Turning off everything transmitting data between the screen and OptiStick, such as the HDMI-CEC, Dolby Vision, or auto adapting resolution



### Fixing the OnHold Warning

![device is onhold message](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147900625555)

This warning displays when the device is in the [**OnHold Folder**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500003244381-About-the-OnHold-Devices-Folder). This happens when you’ve ordered more devices than you had licenses for. Any devices above your license limit will automatically be placed in the OnHold folder and will need to be removed, even when the license limit has been raised.

### App Crashing

To handle crashes, clear the cache and then data of the OptiSigns Player, then reboot. You may need to Factory Reset.

App crashes are most common when is kept on for extremely long periods of time. To avoid them, schedule a **Restart Timer**.
