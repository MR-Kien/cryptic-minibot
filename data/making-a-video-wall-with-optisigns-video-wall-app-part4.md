**Type** \- The Type of content to display. You’ll choose from **Asset** , **Playlist** , or **Schedule** , then choose the piece of content you want to display.

Clicking the **Gear** icon will lead you to this screen:

**Audio Zone** \- Lets you choose which screen the audio will come from. This can be **All** , or any one of the **HDMI ports** you've assigned a screen to.

**Primary Zone** \- Setting one of your screens as a Primary Zone will provide a better experience or smoother content transition when you need to coordinate contents in different zones and put use the video wall app in a playlist.

  * For example, if the primary zone is utilizing Playlist A, Playlist B and its video wall asset will respect the duration of Playlist A's asset. It will only transition to the next item when the asset in the Primary Zone's playlist is complete, rather than follow the duration setting of the video wall asset placed in Playlist B. This is a great way to avoid videos being cut off early.



For more information on these zones, see our guide on [Advanced Playlist Item Playback Control and Campaign Management.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/22474034993043-Advanced-Playlist-Item-Playback-Control-Campaign-Management)

Should you choose content and assign it to your screens in this way, your video wall will function almost like a split screen, with each screen displaying different content or repeating images:

### Merging Screens to Create a Continuous Image or Video

To create one continuous image, the screens will need to be merged.

To do this, click the **Merge Screens** button:

Then, select the screens you’d like to merge:

These two screens will now be merged, and considered the same Zone:

You can continue merging screens if you have a third to create a video wall that looks like the image below, with one continuous image.
