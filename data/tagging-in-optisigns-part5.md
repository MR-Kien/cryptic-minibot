These “location” tags allow screens in a specific spot to receive commands quickly. The “device” type lets your IT team and our support team quickly identify the type of screen or device you’re running OptiSigns on in case of a problem. A “purpose” tag lets you identify which screens are being used for what purpose (ex. “Marketing” or “Internal”).

As we’ve mentioned before, setting these tags allows you to quickly push Assets, Playlists, or Schedules to screens, but there’s more to it. It also lets you batch update your hardware with the latest version of OptiSigns

Don’t forget: it’s possible to add as many tags as you’d like to any given screen or asset, so don’t hesitate to create complex webs or simple notation as you like. Feel free to experiment with the feature to make the easiest experience for your business.
