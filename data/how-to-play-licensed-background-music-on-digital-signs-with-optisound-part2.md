*Setting the audio priority ensures your background music keeps playing, even when showing muted videos or other content.

### **Step 3: Connect Your Device to Your Audio System**

To play the music through your business’s sound system you can either:

  * Pair the device via **Bluetooth** to your speaker setup.



Double-check your device’s audio output settings to make sure it matches your connection type.
