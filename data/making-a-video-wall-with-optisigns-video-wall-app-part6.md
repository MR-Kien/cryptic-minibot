For example, Raspberry Pi 4 can output 2 screens, you can buy a PC running Windows, and Linux with multiple HDMI, Display Ports output and easily make up 2-6 screens video wall.

Just download OptiSigns player for Win, Linux, and Raspberry Pi (version 4.2.9 or higher required).

Arrange your screens setup as extended and set the position of the screens.

Run OptiSigns app, and resize the player to fill up across all the screens. This can be done in two ways:

  1. Dragging the app to fill up all screens (least precise method)
  2. Fixing your screen size using the Override Win Size & Position (recommended)



#### Option 1: Dragging the App to Fill Up All Screens

This is a simple, basic technique whereby you simply drag the OptiSigns app window to fill up your extended video wall display, like below:

This is the easiest method, but does not provide precise control over how large your screen will be. Remember to hide your taskbar, to make OptiSigns fill in all the screens. 

#### Option 2: Fixing Screen Size Using the Override Win Size & Position Option (Recommended)

To get the most precisely optimized video wall, you'll want to follow these steps. First, in your OptiSigns app, click on the **Hamburger Menu**.

This will open up a list of options. **Disable Fullscreen on Startup:**

Now, scroll down to the **Override Win Size & Position **option:

Once selected, you'll see this screen:

Set the width and height to match the resolutions of your screens.

Next time your system starts up, OptiSigns will auto-start up and remember the size, and position.

That's it!

You now have a video wall with OptiSigns.
