If we go back to the demo Control Center, and put in the data that we want to send to the screen, and the Enterprise App asset id, then click Save. It will take over the screen and load the Enterprise App on the screen with the data that we sent over.  
Once done, you can click the "Stop" button to end the integration.

To verify the data that was sent to the screen, you can go back to the OptiSigns portal, find the screen. Expand the "Advanced" section, then expand "More" section. 

At the bottom of the Edit Screen page, click the button to show the Device Specific Info. You can see the same data sent from the demo Control Center.

On the screen, you will see those data sent from the demo Control Center are displayed accordingly. Including the customer name, car model, advisor name, and the image.
