The **Undo** option does what it says on the tin - it undoes the last action. If this button is pushed in error, the **Redo** button will fix it.

**NOTE**  
---  
The Undo command can also be performed using **CTRL+Z** on a Windows machine or **Cmd+Z** on a Mac. Redo can be performed using **CTRL+Y** on Windows or **Cmd+SHIFT+Z** on Mac.

## Toolbar - Positioning

The Toolbar on the right hand is primarily used for positioning elements of your design via **Zoom, Layer, History,** and the **Hand Tool** functions.

### Zoom

Shows the level of **Zoom** on the design. Can be adjusted with the ‘+’ or ‘-’ buttons.

### Layers

The **Layers** button allows you to change the layering of the elements on your design.

When clicked, it will open the **Position** window on the Side Menu, under the **Layers** tab.

Note that widgets cannot be rearranged and will always be overlaid on top of the design.

### History

Selecting the **History** button will allow you to view the history of all changes made to the design.
