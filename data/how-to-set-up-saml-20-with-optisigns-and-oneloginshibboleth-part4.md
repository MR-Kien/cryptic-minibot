### **That's it!**

You have configured SAML 2.0 for OptiSigns with OneLogin using the Shibboleth connector.

Now your users can log in using the subdomain that you configured (in this case it was <https://advanced.optisigns.net/signIn>).

You can share the URL with your users and they can log in with their SSO credentials.
