An art gallery has digitally organized all their artwork images and videos into categorized folders for easy access. The goal is to convert these assets into an interactive kiosk. Visitors to the gallery can use the kiosk to click on images, viewing each piece of artwork in detail. The system enhances their experience by allowing them to visualize how each artwork would look in different settings, such as a living room, with the help of images showing the art in various staged environments.

## What is a Content Library Kiosk?

Think of it as organizing computer files with folders:

  * You create a Root folder on the Files/Assets page, which serves as the central directory for all your content.
  * Within the root folder, you create Subfolders that act as categories or themes, providing an organized structure.
  * Your digital assets are placed in these subfolders, typically grouping together similar items or materials related to the folder's theme. This organization makes it easy to find and access specific content, creating an organized and user-friendly experience for your audience.



Now that you have everything digitally organized, you're ready to transform it into an interactive kiosk for your customers to engage with.
