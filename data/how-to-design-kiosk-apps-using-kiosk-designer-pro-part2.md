For a direct URL, here are the link options to choose from:

  * **Duration (seconds):** Sets the maximum duration of how long your asset will display on the screen before returning to the main page.
  * **Preload:** Defaults to checked. Preload the URL or asset in the background to allow for instant display. This improves user experience. However, if you have animation or dynamic content on your page, you may want to disable this.
  * **Close Icon:** Allows you to customize where you would like the Close icon to display on your asset. 
    * None
    * Top Left
    * Top Right
    * Bottom Left
