**_Recommended Device_**

When using an OptiSigns Android Stick, the OptiSigns app is:

  * **Completely Locked Down:** Users can only interact with the content being displayed on the screen.
  * **Side Menu Inaccessible:** Users cannot open the OptiSigns side menu, exit the app, unpair the screen, or mess with the device



Due to OS-level control with the OptiSigns Android Stick, this method provides the most cohesive lock down. 

#### **Limitations**

  * **Setting Up Your Screen:** You will need to use either our OptiSigns portal or Mobile Admin App to set up your screen with content prior to locking it down.

## Windows Devices

You will need to disable edge swipe to prevent users from swiping out of the application. Instructions on how to do this may differ based on your device. (Through your device's Local Group Policy Editor, Registry Editor, etc.).

Once done, a Windows device in lockdown mode will be:

  * **Completely Locked Down:** Users can only interact with the content being displayed on the screen.
  * **Side Menu Inaccessible:** Users cannot open the OptiSigns side menu, exit the app, unpair the screen, or mess with the device.



#### **Limitations**

  * **Keyboard and Mouse Required:** A mouse is needed to access the deactivation window. Click on the uppermost top part of the screen six times with a mouse to deactivate. Then, use a keyboard to type in the password.

## Android Tablets and Devices

When using lock down mode on an Android tablet:

  * **Locks Side Menu:** This prevents users from accessing the OptiSigns side menu, thereby blocking the ability to unpair the device, change its orientation, and alter other specific device settings.
  * **Enhance Security and Usability:** It is recommended to enable the "Keep Awake" feature, which ensures the screen remains on even if users attempt to turn it off.
