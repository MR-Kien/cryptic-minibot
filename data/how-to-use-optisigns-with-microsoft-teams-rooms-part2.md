## Send to a Teams Rooms Device

Whichever method you've used, you'll need to send your Source to a Teams Rooms device. To begin, click **Assign to rooms**.

There are several parts to take note of here:

  * **Show Teams Rooms banner** \- Displays Room information over top of your digital signage when selected. Remove if you do not want this overlay.
  * **Display Period** \- These settings allow you to configure how quickly your display changes from Teams Rooms settings to your signage.
  * **Allow screen timeout when device is idle** \- When selected, this will keep your default screen settings for timing it out. Deselect this if you want your signage to continuously display.



Once you’ve tweaked these settings to your liking, hit **Next**. You’ll be taken to the Assign rooms screen.

## Set Up the Virtual Screen App (ALTERNATE METHOD)

Set up a [Virtual Screen app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055900513-How-to-create-and-use-Virtual-Screen-App) as an alternative to the OptiSigns Web Player. This app will provide an alternate URL to use as a Source in our Microsoft Teams Rooms Portal to set up digital signage.

To get started, click **Files/Assets** within the OptiSigns app and navigate to **Apps**.
