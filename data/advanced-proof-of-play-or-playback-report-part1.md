With OptiSigns you can enable tracking of playback of your contents.

When Proof-of-play Report is enabled, the screen will report the starting and ending timestamp of each asset it played.

You can also include Assets Tags and Screens Tags that will allow you to create complex aggregated reports.

This feature is available for **Pro-Plus** or above subscription plans.

**Feature summary:**

  * Track starting, ending timestamp of each assets played
  * Data can be collected real-time or by upload interval (useful for cases where you have devices with limited internet, and only do a "drive-by" once a week/month to collect data)
  * Slide & dice report in your admin portal: <https://app.optisigns.com/app/playbackReport>
  * Reports can be filtered, saved and scheduled to email to any email addresses 
  * Raw data can be exported for your custom reporting

By default, screens will update data in real-time as assets are played.  
If internet is disconnected, data will be saved locally and will be synced to server automatically when the device come back online.

If for some reason, you don't want real-time data (i.e. to reduce network usage during day time, or if you do "drive-by" data collection once a while). You can unchecked Real-time option and select an upload interval of your choice.

Once enabled, within a few minutes, all of your screens will start sending back proof-of-play data.

You can now go to Analytics tab to view the report.

**2\. Setup: (Optional) Setting Tags to your Screens, Assets**

This step is optional, but it's usually useful for you to set tags for your screens and assets it will make reporting, grouping data later on easier.
