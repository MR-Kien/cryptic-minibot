**3\. Put the Live TV on your screens**

Now the video streaming app is available for use, you can assign it to any screens you want to show the Live TV. Please make sure that the screens need to be in the same network as the HDMI video encoder, so that the HLS stream is accessible by your screens. For more information on how to assign content to the screens, you can refer to [this article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016375153).
