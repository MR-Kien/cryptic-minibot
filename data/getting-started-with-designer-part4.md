**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
---  
How your image is resized is determined by which part of the text you drag from. If you drag **from the sides** , this will **Crop** your image. Dragging **from the corners** will maintain the aspect ratio of the selection and **resize** it automatically.  
  
Clicking the Shape or Element will change the Top Menu and apply directly to the selection:
