**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
---  
These Content Tag rules **will not** apply to screen Previews. This is because Previews are limited by web browser - your screen, however, should display properly.  
  
  * **Lobby Display:** Suppose your global playlist is tagged 'Front-Lobby' as the Playlist default. All assets within this playlist will be tagged as 'Front-Lobby.'

  * **Back Room Display:** If you have a specific asset you want to play in the back room within the global playlist, you can tag that asset as 'Back-Room'. 



  * **Edit Screen > Selective Content Display:**



On the Edit Screen level, you can set your content rule for your Front Lobby screens. In this example, the content tag rule is set to **include** items tagged as **'Front-Lobby'**. This way, the screen will only display assets tagged as 'Front-Lobby' from your global playlist and ignore any assets or sub-playlists that do not have the 'Front-Lobby' tag. So, anything tagged Back-Room will not display.

For your screens in the Back Room, you can set your content rule to **include** items tagged as **'Back-Room'**. This way, only assets tagged as 'Back-Room' from your global playlist will be displayed, and any assets or sub-playlists that do not have the 'Back-Room' tag will be ignored. So, anything tagged Front-Lobby will no display.

You also have the option to set an exclusion rule, which will prevent any assets with specific tags from being displayed on the selected screen.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and customize tags for playlists and individual assets.

**That's it!**
