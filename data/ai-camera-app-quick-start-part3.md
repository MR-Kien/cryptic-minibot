You can view how the asset is configured

**Play Settings:**

  * Play for at least: when detected, the app will play the content corresponding to detection rule for at least X seconds. (Default is 3s)
  * Rest for: the device will wait for at least X seconds (Default: 3s) before triggering additional content if multiple rules are detected.



We recommend to keep Play for at least and Rest for at 3s, to give smooth feeling experience when in crowded place like mall, or an airport with many people walking by very quickly.

**Play Rules:**

  * Effective Time: This refers to the time frame during which the feature is active and the specific days it applies to.
  * If Detected: This describes how the AI camera determines when to trigger a change.
  * Play Content: This pertains to the asset assigned to play when a specific gender is detected.



After completing the previous steps, you will be directed to the "Assign to Screen" page. Here, you will assign the AI camera to the specific screen on which you want the camera to trigger.
