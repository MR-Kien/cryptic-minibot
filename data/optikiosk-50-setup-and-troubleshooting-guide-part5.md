  1. Open the **Settings** app.
  2. Scroll down and select System.
  3. Tap Reset options.
  4. Choose Erase all data (factory reset).
  5. Confirm your choice to begin the reset.



This will erase all data from the kiosk’s internal storage, including Google accounts, system and app data, downloaded apps, music, photos, and any other user content. After the reset is complete, the device will restart with its original factory settings.
