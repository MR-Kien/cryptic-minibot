Before we can do that, we’ll need to set up our Teams. Teams act like a bucket where users can be assigned based on the level of permissions we want them to have. With our folders set up, it becomes easier to see what Teams we’ll want to create, but you can also start with this step and set up the folders later. For more information, see our article on [**Teams and Security Levels**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034883113-Working-with-Teams-and-Security-Levels).

In this example, we’ll want to create a Team for each store location. In addition, we’ll want to set up a Team for any managers of the Los Angeles City/Subregion; California state; and Pacific Region. We’ll then use Folder permissions to restrict access to each nested folder to the appropriate Team. By doing this, only the Account Owner and Super Admins will have access to the full structure.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
---  
For increased centralization, you can remove Teams at various levels. If you want a 100% centrally managed system with no input outside your IT department, you can skip this step entirely. OptiSigns is extremely flexible and can be configured to any structure you like.  
  
To get started, go to **Account Members** under your user profile.

You’ll see the **Default Team** , which for now should only consist of the Account Owner. The Default Team is typically reserved for central management, and people within this team will be able to see the entire organizational structure. In this example, our Default Team will represent the national level, able to view all screens across our company. They will also be responsible for adding any new screens and moving them between teams as needed.

To continue, click **Add Team**.

The following screen will appear:

Here, we’ve named the team after the region, which will be managing all screens in the region. We’ve also written a short description of the team's purpose. We’ll set up the “Number of screens limit” later, once all our screens are set up.
