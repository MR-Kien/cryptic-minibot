    * Example: Playlist A has four videos of varying durations placed in the primary zone. Playlist B has four different images placed in the selected zone. The four images in playlist B will re-calculate each duration individually to correspond to the matching asset duration playing in the Primary Zone. Note that this feature only works if Playlist A and Playlist B have the same number of assets.
  * Respect primary zone video timing: With this checked, when the split screen asset is put as an item inside a playlist, the player will respect the duration of Primary Zone's playlist, and let it finish playback before transitioning to the next item.

#### **4) How to use Play Every feature**

The **Play Every** feature allows you to control the playback of the playlist items at a repeated interval. What's more, it is not simply playing the item at the set interval, it will wait until the last item playback is completed, then kick in to provide a smoother transition and a better experience.

A major use case would be if you want to reinforce a specific message, or if you have a contractual agreement to provide exposure to content e.g. every hour.

It is very simple to use the Play Every feature. Simply click the setting button of the item, then set the interval accordingly. Once it is set, you will see a timer-like icon on the item, which will help you easily identify the items where Play Every is enabled.

Please note: the Play Every feature will only work in the root level playlist, when it is set in the sub-playlist it will not work. Also, when Play Every is set on the item, the item playback will be controlled by the interval set, and the position where the item is placed in the playlist will not matter.

**5\. How to use Content Tags in a playlist**

To first use content tags, you will need to assign tags to either individual assets or an entire playlist. To learn more about asset tagging and how it works, please follow **[our guide on Tagging in OptiSigns.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/38062664690195-Tagging-in-OptiSigns)** You can tag playlists by going to your desired playlist, opening the playlist options, changing Target Tags to "Use Playlist Default", and inputting any tags you'd like. This tag will apply to everything within the playlist, unless you assign custom tags to assets within a playlist.
