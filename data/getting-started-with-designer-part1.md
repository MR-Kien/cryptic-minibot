## Canvas

The Designer viewer is where your design lives. Each element is visible and selectable within the window.

Elements can be moved, resized, deleted, and more from here.

## Top Menu - Basic Functions

The Top Menu of the Design window is where basic functions can be found. These include adding images, text, shapes, backgrounds, filters, animation, and frames, naming your design, drawing, and resizing your design.

### Naming Your Design

By default, each new design will be titled “Your new untitled design,” as shown below.

![designer name entry](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42087941844243)

We recommend changing this name as soon as possible, as, while it is possible to save a design with the default name, it will be hard to identify in your Assets folder.
