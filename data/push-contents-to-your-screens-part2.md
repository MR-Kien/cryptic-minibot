### What Happens if Your Screen Already has an Assigned Playlist?

When the target screens are currently running a playlist, when you push the contents to the screen, you will be given the option to either include the asset in the currently running playlist or override the playlist with the asset. It will show "**Screens(s) using playlist** ".

  * **Add this asset to the end of the current playlist(s) the screen(s)** : This will add the asset to the end of the current playlist. You can also set the duration (in seconds) to it. 
  * **Assign this asset to the selected screen(s)** : This will just assign this asset to the screen directly.
