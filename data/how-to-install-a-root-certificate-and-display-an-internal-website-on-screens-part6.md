To set it up, navigate to **Files/Assets** in your OptiSigns portal. Find the **Website** app.

Enter the **URL** of your webpage here. The Name field is irrelevant to the app’s function and will only make the asset easier to find in OptiSigns.

**NOTE**  
---  
If your internal website is large and complex, you can also display it using the **Advanced Website** app. If you’re having trouble displaying it on the basic Website app, create an Advanced Website asset and try again.  
  
Once the Website asset is created, it can be assigned to a screen.

### Using Web Scripting to Bypass Logins

Many internal websites require logins to work. In this case, the Website app will not be sufficient to access them on the OptiSigns app. In this case, we recommend our Web Scripting app.

Follow our complete [guide to using the Web Scripting app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012522362-How-to-use-the-Web-Scripting-App) to set that up.
