To do this, you'll need to allow [**webplayer.optisigns.com**](https://webplayer.optisigns.com/) to be installed on your ChromeOS devices.

## **Workaround 2: Download OptiSigns App from the Google Play Store**

Downloading the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.optisigns.playe1&hl=en-US) is another easy method. However, auto-start will need to be configured manually.

## **Workaround 3: Download the OptiSigns Android APK from OptiSigns Website**

We have tested and confirmed that the OptiSigns Android APK works on Chrome OS devices even when the Chrome App no longer runs.

**How to Install the APK:**

**Download the APK**  
\- Go to the official OptiSigns [website](https://www.optisigns.com/download) and download the latest [Android APK](https://download.optisignsapp.com/Android/optisigns_googleVersion_release_latest_stable.apk).

  1. **Enable “Unknown Sources”**
     1. Go to **Settings → Security & Privacy → Install unknown apps**.
     2. Allow installation from your browser or file manager.
  2. **Install the APK**
     1. Open the downloaded APK in the Files app.
     2. Follow prompts to install.
  3. **Launch OptiSigns**
     1. Find it in your launcher, sign in, and start using your displays.



Note that to run the APK, you will need access to [**Developer Mode**](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

## **Recommendations**

  * If you still need kiosk mode, use the APK in combination with Chrome OS kiosk settings (if supported by your device).
  * Keep Chrome OS updated to the latest version your device supports.
  * For long-term deployments, consider switching to a fully supported [Android](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware) or [Pro/ProMax](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware) player.
