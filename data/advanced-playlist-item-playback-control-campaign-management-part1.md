OptiSigns includes playlist settings for you to control playlist item playback. This allows you granular control, and lets you control the item playback in a specific way.

For example, if you have an advertising need, you may want to have the sub-playlist play a couple of items only each round, or you may want an ad to play once every 30 minutes. These advanced playlist settings are perfect for these situations. 

There are 5 advanced settings we will cover in this document:

  1. **Sub-playlist control**. With Sub-playlist control, you can define how many items you want to play from the sub-playlist when the sub-playlist is embedded as a nested playlist. It can help you better manage the time allocation of a certain type of content. 
  2. **Resume on next play**. With this enabled, the playlist will start from where it left off last time, instead of starting from the beginning. This may provide a better experience when the playlist has to be interrupted for any reason. 
  3. **Split Screen primary zone with playlist**. This will provide a better experience or more smoother content transition if you use Split Screen to organize relevant content together and put it as an item in a playlist. The playlist will respect the duration of the content in the primary zone and let its playback finish before moving to the next item in the playlist.
  4. **Play Every Setting**. With this, you can define how you want to have the item repeated. For example, if you have a contractual agreement that an ad will play once every hour, this setting will put a timer on the item, and try to play it once every hour.
  5. **Content Tagging:** This allows you to better control and customize the playback of your playlist items, enabling you to mix and match content for different screens within the same playlist and simplify screen management. You can set rules for your screens that determine which tagged assets or sub-playlists are displayed on each screen.



#### **1) How to use sub-playlist control**

The setting is available in the playlist options.   
Click on the playlist options if you want to set it for a certain playlist, so when that playlist is used as a sub-playlist in other places, it will inherit the setting.

Or configure it at the playlist item level for a sub-playlist, the setting will only be applied on the playlist.
