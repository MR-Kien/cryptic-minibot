Monitoring & Alert is a Pro Plus and Enterprise feature that will allow you to receive notifications when devices are down.

**You will be able to set up:**

  * Which devices to monitor, maybe not all devices are important (you can choose to receive devices with certain tags only i.e. [important screens])
  * How many minutes or hours of downtime before notification sent
  * To whom the notification should be sent (list of emails)
  * You can create as many rules as you like (i.e. Location A screens down will send email to admin in Location A, Location B screens down will send email to admin in location B, etc.)



**Here are some best practices for you to get the most out of this feature and your screens:**

  * Set the right expectation: if you have a lot of screens, it is probably not practical to set a goal of 100% screen up 24/7, for objective reasons like network, power, or hardware failure there may be some devices down for some time.
  * If you expect your devices to run for X hours/day, you can run the [Proof of Play report](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058936513) by devices and see how many hours your devices have run over last 7-30 days and see which devices are not meeting the X hours/day goal
  * Set up a process, and training in place for the location's admin to help you troubleshoot when there are issues.
  * If you are not running your screen 24/7, say your business hour is 7 AM - 7 PM, set an alert if downtime is >13 hours so you will not have a notification every day, and still be able to catch the screen down within 24 hours.
