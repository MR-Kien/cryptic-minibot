Use Case  
---  
A clothing store uses a rotating playlist on their screens to showcase seasonal collections, promotions, and styling tips. This dynamic display engages customers, keeps content fresh, and drives sales by highlighting new arrivals and special offers.  
**NOTE**  
---  
If you're new to OptiSigns, you'll be using one of two interfaces: the **1.0** interface, or the **2.0** interface. For your convenience, we've provided screenshots of each.  
  
## Let's Get Started:

You can add various types of content to your playlists, including images, videos, web links, and apps. These items can be mixed and matched in any order and duration.

**1.** First, you will need to **create an asset** from your [Files/Assets page](https://app.optisigns.com/app/assetManagement) to add content to your playlist.

**2.** Alternatively, you can click the '**Playlists** ' tab, then on the right side, click '**New**.' From there, you can either create an asset or upload files, templates, or feeds.

**Example:**

**OptiSigns 1.0** | **OptiSigns 2.0**
