To recover your data, connect the encrypted OptiSigns Player to another device using a USB enclosure or other preferred method. When you try to access the Player’s hard drive, you’ll be prompted to enter the encryption password you set earlier:

![authentication required password input](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40212027794067)

By inputting this password, you’ll be able to access the data and use it however you see fit.
