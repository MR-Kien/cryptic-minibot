Android TV devices are not rated as commercial grade hardware, and are normally not very powerful. If your use cases require 3+ more zones, multiple heavy content at a time, or keep your digital signage contents running 24x7. Please consider using professional grade devices, such as the [OptiSigns Pro Player](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware) or other windows, Linux devices that more powerful and industrial/commercial grade rated. These devices are more robust hardware which are built to handle heavy content and can be played continuously for longer duration.
