**What does inclusion and exclusion rules mean?**

**Inclusion** | **Exclusion**  
---|---  
**And:** Will show assets that have all the tags selected. **Or:** Will show any asset with at least one of the tags selected. |  **And:** Will **not show** any assets that have all tags selected. **Or:** Will **not show** any asset with at least one of the tags selected.  
  
  * **\+ Rule:** Will add an additional box for you to add more tags.
  * **+Ruleset:** Will create additional rules to attach to your original tag rules. 



In this example, any assets **with the location-A tag** in the selected playlist **will** **display** on this screen. Other assets in this playlist **without location-A tag will not display** on the screen.

## **How to Set Up 'Use Playlist Default'**

When you choose 'Use Playlist Default,' you set a tag for the entire playlist. The assets within the playlist that are set to 'Use Playlist Default' will automatically be tagged with the playlist default tag you set at the playlist level.

**Note:** These tags do not affect the tags you have placed on your files/assets page.

Similar to using 'Use Asset Default', if you set your **Content Tag rule** to **include or exclude any assets** with the **same default tag as the playlist** in the selected playlist, then only those assets **will be displayed** on the screen.

Other assets in the playlist **without the same tag** **will not be displayed** on the screen.

**NOTE**  
---  
Letter case matters. Ensure when pairing Playlist tags to your screen that the tags match _exactly._  
  
### **Custom Content Tagging**

If you want a specific asset or nested playlist to have a different tag, follow these steps:

  * Select the **asset** or **nested** **playlist** within the current playlist.
  * Click the **cog** **icon** next to it.
  * Change the Target tag from '**Use** **Playlist** **Default** ' to '**Custom**.'
  * Input your desired tag in the box below '**Custom**.'



**Example Scenario**

To help illustrate how this feature works, we will use the following simple scenario as an example:

> A hotel has one screen in the lobby and one screen in the back room. There is one global playlist pushed to both screens, but I want to control which assets within the global playlist play on each screen.
